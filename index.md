## Welcome to GitHub Pages

Welcome to my page! im pleased to see you want to learn more about me. I will now show you through pictures some of my interests. 

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/aichas2962/aichas2962.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
